# Porting-Godot
Documentation on how SPECIFICALLY to port Godot to a platform.

The Godot official docs are extremely vague on how to create a fully fleshed out port of Godot, so I have created this to aid a dev looking to port Godot (4) to a given platform.

Currently this is only centered around Godot 4. Godot 3 and prior are going to be distinctly different in their porting insofar as graphics are concerned, and I have not personally ported Godot 3 and prior to any platform, only Godot 4.
